Hi! My name is **Yangbing Xu** (**ÂæêÊù®ÂÜ∞** in Chinese) and I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Ocean Science at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/). I received my BS in Aquaculture in 2019 from the [Ocean University of China (OUC)](https://www.ouc.edu.cn/).

I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Charmaine Yung](https://www.charmaineyung.com/). My research delved into the ecology and evolution of eukaryotic phytoplankton and their viruses with the combination of traditional cultivation, physiology, and multi-omics approaches.

### I am currently interested in answering the following questions: 
1. How much diversity is there in eukaryotic phytoplankton and viruses? 
2. Can we obtain high-quality eukaryotic/viral genomes without cultivation?
3. What is the evolutionary history of the early green lineage? Giant viruses?
4. Who is the host of a specific marine viruses?
5. How climate change will influence eukaryotic phytoplankton communities?

My CV is here: [Yangbing XU's Curriculum Vitae](https://github.com/Yangbing-Ocean/yangbing/blob/master/assets/CV_Yangbing_Xu.pdf).
