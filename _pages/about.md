Hi! My name is **Yangbing Xu** (**ÂæêÊù®ÂÜ∞** in Chinese) and I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Ocean Science at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/). I received my B.S. in Aquaculture in 2019 from the [Ocean University of China (OUC)](https://www.ouc.edu.cn/).

I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Charmaine Yung](https://www.charmaineyung.com/). My research delves into the ecology and evolution of eukaryotic phytoplankton and their viruses with the combination of traditional cultivation, physiology, and multi-omics approaches.

### I am currently interested in answering the following questions: 
1. What is the extent of biodiversity within eukaryotic phytoplankton and the viruses that infect them? 
2. Is it possible to acquire high-quality eukaryotic and viral genomes without the need for cultivation?
3. What are the evolutionary origins and diversification of the early green lineage? and how about giant viruses?
4. Who is the host of a specific marine viruses?
5. How will the impacts of climate change reshape the composition and dynamics of phytoplankton communities?
