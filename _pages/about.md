Hi! My name is **Yangbing Xu** (**徐杨冰** in Chinese) and I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Ocean Science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I received my BS in Aquaculture in 2019 from the Ocean University of China (OUC).

I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Charmaine Yung](https://www.charmaineyung.com/). My research delved into the ecology and evolution of eukaryotic phytoplankton and their viruses with the combination of traditional cultivation, physiology, and multi-omics approaches.

**I am currently addressing the following questions: **
1. How much diversity is there in eukaryotic phytoplankton and viruses? 
2. Can we obtain high-quality eukaryotic/viral genomes without cultivation?
3. What is the evolutionary history of the early green lineage? Giant viruses?
4. Who is the host of a specific marine viruses?
5. How climate change will influence eukaryotic phytoplankton communities?
