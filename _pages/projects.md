ðŸŒŸThe genomic diversity and adaptation of eukaryotic picophytoplankton Mamiellales
======
I have a longstanding interest in marine phytoplankton. During my doctoral program, I isolated more than 300 Mamiellales strains from the South China Sea using strategies like selective media, flow cytometry, and plaque assays. I have purified and characterized several new clades or species from those cultures, including _Ostreococcus_ Clade E and F, _Bathycoccus_ Clade BIII, _Mantoniella tinhauana_. Leveraging long-read whole genome sequencing and global metagenomic data, I am looking into their biogeography, diversification, adaptation, and evolution. Part of the findings have been published in peer-reviewed journal articles (Xu et al., ISME J, 2024; Rey Redondo et al., Front. Microbiol., 2024).

ðŸŒŸInsights into the phytoplankton-virus interactions through Mamiellales-Prasinovirus model system
======
Having established algal cultures, I then sampled plenty of samples from various marine environments to isolate prasinoviruses from the Mamiellales hosts. We are examining the structural characteristics, decoding the genetic makeup, and elucidating the infection dynamics of these viruses. These Mamiellales-Prasinovirus model systems that we have developed offer deep insights into complex interactions between giant viruses and eukaryotic phytoplankton. One collaborative study with the GENOPHY group at the Observatoire OcÃ©anologique de Banyuls has been published (Thomy et al., ISME common., 2024).
