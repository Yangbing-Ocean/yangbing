ðŸŒŸVirus-host Dynamics in Changing Seas
======
* Ph.D in Version Control Theory, GitHub University, 2018 (expected)

ðŸŒŸThe genomic diversity and adaptation of eukaryotic picophytoplankton Mamiellales
======
* I successfully isolated more than 200 Mamiellales strains from the South China Sea during my doctoral study. I have purified and identified several new clades or species from those cultures, including _Ostreococcus_ Clade E and F, _Bathycoccus_ Clade BIII, _Mantoniella tinhauana_. I look into their genomes through

ðŸŒŸInsights into the phytoplankton-virus interactions through Mamiellales-Prasinovirus model system
======
* I also have sampled plenty of samples over the past four years to isolate giant viruses from the Mamiellales hosts. 

ðŸŒŸGenome-resolved insights into the diversity and functions of microbial community in subtropical waters
======
* Spring 2024: Academic Pages Collaborator
